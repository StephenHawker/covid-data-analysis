app.py - Parquet file processing using EC2 / S3 bucket
======================================================

## Description

Using any language or combination of languages except .NET (e.g. Bash script, Python, R, Java, Scala, etc) using AWS SDK libraries (e.g. boto, Java
SDK, except .NET) or the AWS CLI (bash script) write an app/script that:

Locally creates a Parquet file with some data in it (the nature of the data and size, is not important)
Creates an S3 bucket, and uploads the parquet file to the bucket
Creates an IAM Role that gives Read & List access to the S3 bucket
Spins up an EC2 instance that has the above IAM Role attached

Install R on the EC2 instance
Copies a “Parquet Reader” R Script (see below for details on this script) to the EC2 instance
Runs the “Parquet Reader” R Script

The AWS credentials used should be picked up in the usual way from ~/.aws/credentials, the particular profile used should be passed in as a
command line argument.
Any other configurable should be passed in as command line arguments. The app/script should be non-interactive.

Parquet Reader R Script
The R Script should
Use credentials via the Instance Profile associated to the IAM Role
Read the parquet file in the S3 bucket, and print out the second record in the parquet file to standard error.
The R libraries used to read and process the file are up to you.

## Requirements

 - Python 3.7 or later.
 - The following Python libraries
   - configparser
   - import sys
   - import math
   - import logging
   - import logging.config
   - import io
   - pandas
   - requests
   - pyarrow (parquet file handling)
   - boto3 - https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html#bucket
   - paramiko (ssh client for EC2)
   - R is available in Amazon Linux Extra topic "R3.4"
     sudo amazon-linux-extras install R3.4
     https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/faqs/#Amazon_Linux_Extras
    This version is too low for many libraries - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59415973/how-to-install-newer-version-of-r-on-amazon-linux-2
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    yum -y install R
   - Configure access via instance profile : https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-instance-access-bucket/
     https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-metadata.html
   
   - .\templates\files\install.sh contains installables post creation of the instance
   
   - .\templates\files\r_script.r contains a template r script which is run on the instance to read the parquet
      file from an S3 bucket
   
## Tools used
- Pycharm Community 2020.1 IDS for python development
- AWS command line interface to setup credentials : https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ 
 - to install the aws client ,  sudo apt-get install awscli or sudo yum install awscli
 - Once installed, run aws configure to create the required profile
 
AWS policy gen : https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html
R 3.4.1
Arrow for R - Please note I couldn't install correctly due to C++ binary issues 
- I tried AWS linux 1 and 2 and Ubuntu 18.04, so unfortunately the R script remains untested.
- Alternative is spark / sparkly are alternatives but ran out of time working on this.

## Run	
Configure convex.ini with the appropriate parameter for security_group_name 
 - security_group_name needs to be a security group that gives your profile user access to the instance
 
 - Install required python packages : pip -r requirements.txt
 - To run, run app.py --profile <profile name to use>
